Software Dev I - Lab 10  
ParkingLot Program (cont.) - District ArrayLists

Assignment:
For this lab, you will revise your Lab 9 solution to use ArrayLists instead of arrays in the District class. You should remove the MAX_LOT class constant in the District class and allow an arbitrary number of parking lots to be added to a district. You should only need to modify the District class. Your solution must not use any arrays.
